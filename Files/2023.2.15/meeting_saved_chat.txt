	Simon, I think it depends a lot on whether you are actually trying to solve the problem efficiently or do something interesting with RL on this space
13:39:39 From  Paulo Rauber  to  Everyone:
	RL doesn't work well with non-stationary environments and requires even more data in that case
13:40:01 From  Paulo Rauber  to  Everyone:
	(multi-agent being non-stationary)
